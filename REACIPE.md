Gather the materials needed on a flat ,clean, and sanitary surface. Take out two slices of your favorite bread. Some of the most common types of bread are white, wheat, sourdough, multigrain, etcâ€¦

Choose your favorite meat(s) and place onto one of the pieces of bread on the side with the condiment. Make sure to spread the meat in a way will go all the way to the edge of the bread. If your meat is round, you can slice the meat in half and place the straight edges along different sides of the piece of bread.  This will allow you to enjoy the desired meat flavor with every bite of your sandwich.

Place your desired amount of the cheese you have chosen on top of the meat. Make sure add enough cheese to cover the entire sandwich.

After the meat, add Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Sweet Peppers, Banana Peppers, Black Olives, and Pickles. Add a line of Honey Mustard and if you're feeling saucy: add a line of Chipotle Southwest. Oil and Vinegar, Salt, Pepper and Oregano are also an added bonus of flavor.
